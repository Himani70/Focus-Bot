Agenda :
	Metadata table, stop task on a pomodoro, assumptions

- We are having a metadata table to store the session starting time for every user on every day.
- Decided to have capability to stop a task once pomodoro is started
- Had a brief discussion on possible assumptions that we need to state. Need to brainstorm more on this in upcoming meetings
